I've also TA'd for LING2000 (Introduction to Linguistics), during a semester where we pivoted from a typical lecture/recitation model to a flipped classroom, where lecture time were used for workshops, and recitations were for working with the students on their analytical skills. In LING2000, we cover introductory concepts ranging from phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, pragmatics, sociolinguistic variation, but the class also emphasizes the students' own research skills by having them present on a language and a notable characteristic.

Since Summer 2024, I've taught an online, compressed version of LING1020 (Languages of the World) via online lectures and assignments. In my version of the class, I focus on teaching students about current advances in linguistic diversity (via guided reading of research papers, instead of a set textbook), introduce them to basic concepts needed for understanding linguistic typology. By the end of the class, students are familiar with key concepts in historical linguistics, typology, and analytic methods in linguistics (such as the comparative method, identifying allophony, morphological analysis, and a basic understanding of semantic roles and how they map to syntax differently in the world's languages).
